The datasets above (six MS Word files) comprise a set of structured questions and corresponding answers addressing the policy requirements outlined in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). The information is presented in Microsoft Word documents, with individual files for each country—Hungary, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Greece, Poland, and Romania. The questionnaire, designed in Word format, has been distributed to these focus countries to gain insights into their specific policy needs.

The dataset above (one Excel file), is a dedicated Excel file where we have stored and evaluated information. Within the framework of Work Packages 2 to 5 (WP2-WP5), our research involves a thorough examination of existing studies, reports, and papers related to Long-Term Renovation Strategies (LTRS), Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), Building Renovation Passports (BRPs), and Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). The insights derived from these work packages will be meticulously organized into individual Excel files, one for each work package. This systematic approach ensures a comprehensive overview of the available literature.

We have seven different csv files as part of our project's later stages, during which we will formulate specific scenarios. These scenarios aim to inform focus countries about viable pathways aligning with the EU Commission's targets. Leveraging the advanced Invert/EE-Lab model, our project specializes in simulating energy-related investment decisions in buildings, focusing on space heating, hot water generation, and space cooling. As a crucial project outcome, we will compile and report data on energy demand, renovation requirements, and related metrics for selected countries—Hungary, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Greece, Poland, and Romania. These outputs will be meticulously documented in csv format for clarity and accessibility.

Context and methodology

These datasets has been generated as part of the EPBD.wise (Effective implementation of the EPBD in line with short-term and long-term policy requirements) project, funded by the LIFE22-CET programme.
These dataset created to to assess the policy needs of countries in meeting the specified requirements.
Datasets were created with different approaches. Six MS Word files were created through an administered questionnaire distributed to the participating countries. One MS Excel file is a collection of literature review with the evaluation of the included reports. Seven csv files are the results of the simulations from a building-stock model.

Technical details

MS Word and MS Excel programs are required to properly open and work on the datasets.
